# Machine-Learning
Machine Learning codes using many different algorithms (some of them implemented in Spark). They belong to different lectures I have coursed in my master in Big Data Analytics.

- Decision/Regression Trees.
- Random Forest.
- KNN.
- Support Vector Machines.
- Gaussian Processes.
- Gaussian Mixtures.
- Neural Networks/Deep Learning.
- Expectation Maximization.
